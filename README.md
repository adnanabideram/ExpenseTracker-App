Expense Tracker iOS App

This is a simple Expense Tracker app developed using SwiftUI and AppStorage for iOS devices. The app allows users to track their monthly expenses and remaining balance in a user-friendly interface. It includes features like setting a new budget, adding expenses, and persistent data storage so your history isn’t lost even if the app is closed or restarted.

	•	Set Budget: Users can set a total amount for their monthly budget.
	•	Track Expenses: Users can enter their expenses with a description and cost.
	•	Add Amount: Users can add extra funds to their current budget.
	•	Delete History: A button allows users to clear all the expenses in the list.
	•	Persistent Storage: The app uses AppStorage to store expenses and the total amount, so data remains even after closing the app.
	•	Responsive UI: A clean and simple user interface built using SwiftUI.
